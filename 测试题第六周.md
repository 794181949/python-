### 题目
determines the maximum number of "spikes" in a shape.
A shape is made up of 1s connected horizontally or vertically (it can contain holes).
A "spike" in a shape is a 1 that is part of this shape and "sticks out" (has exactly one neighbour 
in the shape).
Neighbours are only considered vertically or horizontally (not diagonally).
