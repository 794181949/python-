### 第一题

prompts the user for the face values of coins and their associated quantities as well as for an amount, 
and if possible, outputs the minimal number of coins needed to match that amount, as well as the detail 
of how many coins of each type value are used.

The face values and associated quantities should be input as a dictionary. You might find the literal_
eval() function from the ast module to be useful.

A solution is output from smallest face value to largest face value. If a solution is represented as 
a list of pairs of the form (coin face value, number of coins) ordered from smallest to largest face 
value, then the solutions themselves are output in lexicographical order (for sequences of pairs). 
All face values for a given solution are right aligned.

      def print_solutions(solution):
        max_width = len(str(solution[-1][0])) + 1
        print('\n'.join(f'{"$" + str(value):>{max_width}}:{quality}' for (value, quantity) in solution)

                         'Input a dictionary whose keys represent coin face values\n'
                         'with as value for a given key the number of coins\n'
                         'that are available for the corresponding face value:\n    '
                         ).items(), reverse = True) %对于字典从大到小排序
     nb_of_face_values = len(face_values)
     amount = int(input('Input the desired amount:'))
     minimal_combinations = [[0, []]] + [[float('inf'), []] for i in range(amount)]
     for sub_amount in range(1, amount + 1):
      for i in range(nb_of_face_values):
        value = face_values[i][0]
        if sub_amount < value: 票值过大
          continue

          if value not in option or option[value] < face_values[i][1]: 值不在字典，或者数量小于面值数量
            if minimal_combinations[sub_amount - value][0] + 1 < minimal_combinaionts[sub_amount][0]:
              minimal_combinations[sub_amount][0] = minimal_combinaionts[sub_amount - value][0] + 1
              minimal_combinations[sub_amount][1].clear()
            extended_option = dict(option)
            extended_option[value] = option.get(value,0) + 1
            if extended_option not in minimal_combinations[sub_amount][1]:
              minimal_combinations[sub_amount][1].append(extended_option)
        solutions = sorted(sorted(solution.items()) for solution in minimal_combinaionts[amount][1])
        if not solutions:
                print('\nThere is no solution.')
        elif len(solutions) == 1:
                print('\nThere is a unique solution:')
                print_solution(solutions[0])

### 第三题

it can be shown that every strictly positive integer N can be uniquely coded as a string σ of 0's and 
1's ending with 1, so of the form b 2b 3…b k with k >= 2 N is sum of all Fi
Implement the two functions in the stub, one that takes one argument N mean to to be a 
strictly positive integer and returns its Fibonacci code, and one that takes one argument 
σ meant to be a strict consisting 0's and 1's, returns 0 if σ cannot be a Fibonacci code, 
and otherwise returns the integer σ is the Fibonacci code of.

        bits = ['0'] * len(numbers) + ['1'] %生成列表
        remainder = n
        for i in range(len(numbers) - 1, -len(numbers), -1): %从大到小
          if remainder == 0:
