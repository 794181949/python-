### 题目
First, the encoding (resp. decoding) scheme used here is that each bit is duplicated (resp. halved).

For instance, 424896, in base 2, is 1100111101111000000. Taking the first 2 bits, 11, this decodes to 1, the next 2 bits 00 decodes to 0, and so on until we reach the single 0 which represents a separator, meaning we are moving on to a new number. We then start again with the next 2 bits 11 which decodes to 1, and so on until we reach the end of the string. We are then left with a list of numbers in base 2 as [1011, 11000] which we convert back to base 10 as [11, 24].

The encoding process is the opposite of the above. We take [11, 24] as input, converted to base 2 [1011, 11000]. Taking the first number, we duplicate each bit getting 11001111 then for the separator add a 0 then duplicate each bit in the next number 1111000000. Combined together, it forms a single number 1100111101111000000 which when converted to base 10 is 424896.

This means that if the base 2 number is something like 111 (7), 101 (5), or 11000 (24), it is then impossible to decode.

思路：encode：都转化成二进制然后重复中间用0隔开，decode 反过来得到列表

      
      def encode(list):
        return int('0'.join(''.join(c + c for c in bin(i)[2:]) for i in list_of_integers), 2)
      
      def decode(integer):
        integer = bin(interger)[2:]
        decodings = []
        decoding = ''
        i = 0
        while True:
          if i < len(integer) - 1:
            if integer[i] == [integer[i + 1]:
              decoding += integer[i]
              i += 2
          elif integer[i] == '0':
            decodings.append(decoding)
            decoding = ''
            i += 1
          else:
            return None
          elif i == len(integer) - 1:
            return None
          else:
            decodings.append(decoding)
            return [int(decoding,2) for decoding in decodings]
