### 第一题：
To illustrate, 15!, the factorial of 15, is equal to 1307674368000, hence has 3 trailing 0s.
There are at least three methods to compute the number of trailing 0s in the factorial of a number N at least equal to 5:

1. Divide N! by 10 for as long as it yields no remainder. Note that for a positive integer x, x // 10 "removes" the rightmost digit from x, 
that digit being equal to x % 10.
2. Convert N! into a string and find the rightmost occurrence of a character different to 0. A Google search, or executing dir(str) at the
python prompt, suggests which string method to use. Note that negative indexes (-1 being the index of the last character in a string, -2 
the index of the penultimate character in a string, etc.) is particularly convenient here.
3.Python computes such huge numbers as 1000!, either iteratively multiplying all numbers from 1 up to 1000 or using factorial() from the 
math module (executing import math and then dir(math) at the python prompt confirms that this function is available), and the first two 
methods work for such numbers, but there is a much better method that operates on N rather N!, hence that does not suffer the limitations 
of the first two, and is very efficient. The number of trailing 0s in N! is equal to the number of times N! is a multiple of 10, so to 
the number of times N! is a multiple of 2 x 5. It is easy to verify that N! has at least as many multiples of 2 as multiples of 5. 
Hence the number of trailing 0s in N!
is equal to the number of times N! is a multiple of 5
which is equal to the number of times 5 occurs in the prime decompositions of 1, 2, ..., N-1 and N
which is equal to the number of times 5 occurs at least once in the prime decompositions of 1, 2, ..., N-1 and N, plus the number of
times 5 occurs at least twice in the prime decompositions of 1, 2, ..., N-1 and N, plus the number of times 5 occurs at least thrice in
the prime decompositions of 1, 2, ..., N-1 and N...
which is equal to the number of multiples of 5 at most equal to N, plus the number of multiples of 5^2 at most equal to N, plus the 
number of multiples of 5^3 at most equal to N ...

思路：1.找到x除10的余数0的时候的情况 2.找到最右边那个不为0的数字的位置的正数减去一，3. 判断有几个5的n次方的倍数

    def first_fun(x):
      nb_of_0s = 0
      while x % 10 == 0:
        nb_of_0s += 1
        x // 10
      return nb_of_0s
    
    def second_fun(x):
      if len(x) < 2:
        return 0
      return min(i for i in range(1, len(x)) if x[-i] != '0') - 1
      
    def third_fun(x):
      nb_of_0s = 0
      power = 5
      while x >= power:
        nb_of_0s += x // power
        power *= 5
      retrun nb_of_0s

### 第二题
显示成一个乘法的算法一个3位数乘一个2位数，- such that the sum of all digits in all 4 columns is constant：

    例子：
           4 1 1
         x   1 3
         -------
         1 2 3 3
         4 1 1
         -------
         5 3 4 3

思路：x是100到1000，y是10到100，x乘y的个位数要不能小于1000，第二部分要小于1000，答案是第一部分加第二部分乘10
之后比较每一部分的和是否相等，然后输出出来

    for x in range(10, 1000):
      for y in range(10, 100):
        first_part = x * (y % 10)
        if first_part < 1000:
          continue
        second_part = x * (y //10)
        if second_part > 1000:
          continue
        answer = first_part + second_part * 10
        if (x % 10) + (y % 10) + (first_part % 10) + (answer % 10) == (x //10 % 10) + (y // 10) + (first_part //10 % 10) + (second_part % 10) + (answer // 10 % 10):
            constant = (x % 10) + (y % 10) + (first_part % 10) + (answer % 10)
            if (x //100 % 10)  + (first_part //100 % 10) + (second_part // 10 % 10) + (answer // 100 % 10) == constant:
                if (first_part //1000 % 10) + (second_part // 100 % 10) + (answer // 1000 % 10) == constant:
                  print(f'A solution with all columns adding up to {constant}:')
                    print(' ' * 7 + f'{display_number(x)}')
                    print(' ' * 5 + f'x   {display_number(y)}')
                    print(' ' * 5 + '-------')
                    print(' ' * 5 + f'{display_number(first_part)}')
                    print(' ' * 5 + f'{display_number(second_part)}')
                    print(' ' * 5 + '-------')
                    print(' ' * 5 + f'{display_number(answer)}\n')
                else:
                    continue

### 第三题：
找Perfect numbers
A number is perfect if it is equal to the sum of its divisors, itself excluded. For instance, 
the divisors of 28 distinct from 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7 and 14, and 1+2+4+7+14=28, hence 28 is perfect.

思路：找i在2到N+1中的数，判断1加上其他2到i//2+1之前可能的除数的和是否等于i

for i in range(2,N + 1):
  if 1 + sum(j in range(2, (i // 2 + 1)) if i % j == 0) == i:
    print(i, 'is perfect number')
