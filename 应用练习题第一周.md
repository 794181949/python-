### 第一题：

Temperature conversions
Study the program fahrenheit_to_celsius.py and run it in the Terminal window, executing "python3 fahrenheit_to_celsius.py". 
Then complete the program celsius_to_fahrenheit.py that displays a conversion table from Celsius degrees to Fahrenheit degrees, 
with the former ranging from 0 to 100 in steps of 10; run it and check your solution with the Run and Submit buttons, respectively.

      min_temp = 0
      max_temp = 100
      step = 10
      print('Celcisus\tFahrenheit')
      for cel in range(min_temp, max_temp + step, step):
        fa = cel // 5 * 9 +32
        print(f'{cel:7}\t{fa:7}')

### 第二题：

Then complete the program span.py that prompts the user for a seed for the random number generator, and for a strictly positive 
number, nb_of_elements, generates a list of nb_of_elements random integers between 0 and 99, prints out the list, computes the 
difference between the largest and smallest values in the list without using the builtins min() and max(), prints it out, and 
heck that the result is correct using the builtins; run it and check your solution with the Run and Submit buttons, respectively.
